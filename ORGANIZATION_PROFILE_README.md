# The Birthmark Standard Foundation

**Hardware-backed photo authentication for the AI generation era**

---

## 🎯 Mission

Building open-source infrastructure to prove photos came from real cameras, not AI generators. By storing cryptographic signatures on a blockchain operated by journalism organizations, we're restoring trust in photography.

## 🔍 The Problem

- **AI-generated images** are indistinguishable from real photographs
- **95% of images** lose authentication metadata when shared on social media
- **Trust in media** is collapsing, undermining journalism and public discourse

## ✅ Our Solution

The Birthmark Standard authenticates images at the hardware level using each camera's unique sensor fingerprint. Authentication records are stored on an independent blockchain operated by trusted institutions (universities, archives, journalism organizations).

**Result:** Anyone can verify an image originated from a legitimate camera, even after format conversion or metadata stripping.

## 📦 Repositories

### Core Infrastructure
- **[Birthmark](https://github.com/Birthmark-Standard/Birthmark)** - Main repository with complete Phase 1 implementation
  - Raspberry Pi camera prototype
  - Submission server with manufacturer validation
  - Substrate blockchain (Birthmark Media Registry)
  - Verification interface
  - Storage optimization: 69% reduction (450 → 140 bytes/record)

---

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 1: Hardware Prototype** ✅ Complete

- Camera authentication from raw sensor to blockchain
- Manufacturer validation system
- Public blockchain with 69% storage optimization
- End-to-end pipeline validated
- Operating cost: $200-350/year per node (1M images/day)

**Next:** Phase 2 - Android mobile implementation and user testing

## 🎯 Key Properties

✅ **Hardware root of trust** - Camera sensor fingerprints provide unforgeable device identity
✅ **Privacy preserving** - Rotating keys prevent tracking individual cameras
✅ **Metadata independent** - Verification survives social media sharing
✅ **Open source** - All code publicly auditable
✅ **Decentralized** - No single point of control or failure
✅ **Complementary to C2PA** - Works alongside existing standards

## 📄 License

**Dual License Structure:**
- **AGPL-3.0** - Core blockchain infrastructure (ensures public goods remain public)
- **Apache-2.0** - Camera implementations and verification tools (enables commercial adoption)

This approach protects verification infrastructure while enabling manufacturers to integrate authentication into their products.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

In an age where AI can generate photorealistic images, we need infrastructure that proves what's real. The Birthmark Standard provides:

- **For photojournalists:** Prove your images are authentic when covering important events
- **For fact-checkers:** Quickly determine if viral images came from legitimate cameras
- **For e-commerce:** Prevent product listing fraud with verified photos
- **For the public:** Verify media trustworthiness without relying on platforms or gatekeepers
