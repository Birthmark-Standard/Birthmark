THE BIRTHMARK STANDARD - DUAL LICENSE STRUCTURE

Copyright (C) 2024-2026 The Birthmark Standard Foundation

This repository uses a dual-licensing structure designed to protect the
core trust infrastructure while maximizing adoption of reference implementations.

================================================================================
LICENSING BY COMPONENT
================================================================================

AGPL-3.0-or-later:
------------------
The following components are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0 or later to ensure they remain public infrastructure:

  - packages/blockchain/        (Submission server and blockchain node)
  - packages/registry/          (Birthmark Media Registry)

These components form the core verification infrastructure and must remain
open and transparent. The AGPL ensures that any modifications to these
services are made publicly available, preventing proprietary capture of
the trust layer.

Apache-2.0:
-----------
The following components are licensed under the Apache License v2.0 to
maximize adoption and enable commercial integration:

  - packages/camera-pi/         (Raspberry Pi camera reference implementation)
  - packages/sma/               (Simulated Manufacturer Authority)
  - packages/verifier/          (Verification client interface)
  - shared/                     (Common utilities and cryptographic functions)
  - docs/                       (Documentation and specifications)
  - scripts/                    (Utility scripts)

These components are designed to be freely adopted, modified, and integrated
into commercial products without licensing friction.

RATIONALE
================================================================================

The Birthmark Standard aims to establish trustworthy media authentication as
public infrastructure while enabling commercial adoption by camera manufacturers
and software developers.

AGPL for Core Infrastructure:
------------------------------
The submission server and blockchain registry are the trust anchors of the
system. Using AGPL ensures:

  1. Transparency - All registry nodes must publish their code
  2. Protection from capture - No entity can create proprietary registries
  3. Ecosystem integrity - Modifications remain publicly auditable
  4. Network copyleft - Server operators must share improvements

Apache for Ecosystem Tools:
----------------------------
Camera implementations, verification tools, and developer utilities use
Apache-2.0 to enable:

  1. Manufacturer adoption - No licensing friction for hardware integration
  2. Commercial viability - Companies can build proprietary features
  3. Patent protection - Contributors and users protected from patent claims
  4. Broad compatibility - Compatible with most other open source licenses

This dual-license approach follows the model of successful infrastructure
projects like MongoDB (SSPL for database, Apache for drivers) and Elastic
(SSPL for search, Apache for clients).
