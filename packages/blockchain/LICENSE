RATIONALE FOR AGPL-3.0

This package contains the Birthmark blockchain/submission server infrastructure,
which forms the core trust layer of the Birthmark Standard. We use AGPL-3.0 to
ensure this verification infrastructure remains public and cannot be captured
for proprietary use.

The AGPL's network copyleft provision ensures that anyone operating modified
versions of this server must make their modifications publicly available,
preserving the integrity and transparency of the trust network.
