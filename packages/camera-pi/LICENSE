RATIONALE FOR APACHE-2.0

This package contains the Raspberry Pi camera reference implementation.
We use Apache-2.0 to maximize adoption by camera manufacturers and
hardware developers without licensing friction.

Apache-2.0 allows commercial use, modification, and distribution while
providing patent protection, making it ideal for hardware partnerships.
